The interface of this site, as you can probably tell, is still very much a work in progress.

This is primarily an experiment with the [motion](https://motion.dev) library and an opportunity to explore whatâ€™s possible with state management.

At some point (or, more realistically, never), I might get around to improving the interface beyond just the cards.
